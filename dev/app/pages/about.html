      <h3>A Little About Me</h3>
    </header>
    <p>Hiya! My name is Andrew, I am {{age}} years old, and I love to create beautiful things. I call myself a <a>Creative Front-End Developer</a> because I stand on the sweet spot of where design and code meet.</p>
    <p>I studied Computer Art at community school 3D Animation and Visual Effects at Drexel University, but found a love for coding the web. I consider myself a Front-End Developer with a great eye for design. Many of my design focus on using minimal layouts that focus on the content without distracting the user. Design should tell a story and there should be no confusing points of that story!</p>
    <p>When I'm not designing or coding you can probably find me out playing some ball. Basketball and</p>
